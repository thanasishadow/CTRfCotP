## What is this?
Simpe answer: Something like a minecraft mod which loads some stuff for another mod.

Long answer: A jar file which contains thaumcraft research in the form of json files for [this mod](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/thaumcraft-research-loader) to load on a [modpack](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/circle-of-the-phoenix)

## Why is it on github?
Because this seems like the only way of getting something like this on a curse modpack ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
